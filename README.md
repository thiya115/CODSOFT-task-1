The project aims to classify movie genres using machine learning techniques based on textual data, such as movie descriptions. It involves preprocessing datasets containing movie names, descriptions, and genre labels, and transforming the text using TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful features. Supervised learning models, including Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, are trained on the labeled data to predict genres for new, unseen movie descriptions. The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, ensuring reliable predictions. This approach combines natural language processing and classification techniques to solve the genre prediction task effectively.
